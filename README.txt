== Description ==

Change default search URLs to SEO-friendly URLs, which may enhance your SERP rankings and increase your site traffic. The default URL ?s=keyword will be changed to /search/keyword, and you can adjust the {search base} as needed.

SEO Search Permalink plugin provides four types of permalink structures, filtering out bad words and special characters from search terms. This results in truly clean search URLs for your site.
